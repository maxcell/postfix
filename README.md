React.js Infix to Postfix Project
=================================

This project was an experiment with learning the React.js library as well as learning how to incorporate it with something that could be useful. Inspired by my friend, [Steven Petryk](http://github.com/stevenpetryk). The goal of the project is make a realtime display of infix to postfix for students at UCF as a tool for their studying for the Foundation Exam.

* This is built using the server.rb file from Facebook's React Tutorial. So be sure to have ruby installed on your computer.

### Usage

* Simply go to the directory it is located `cd ./folder/postfix`
* Run the server by `ruby server.rb`
